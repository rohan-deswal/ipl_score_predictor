1. We are using the mean score per ball as a way to denote a bowler/batsman.
2. We are mean score of a venue to denote the venue
3. The above numeric data is being used as parameter for the Deep Neural Network that we have implemented for the training of our Keras Sequential Regressor Model.
4. The Model has following attributes:
	Activation Function: ReLU
	Optimizer: Adam
	Learning Rate for Adam: 0.002
	Training Epochs: 40
5. Update: We have decided to export the weights, biases and normalization values from keras to pytorch.
6. The decision was due to the fact that we were getting Time Limit Exceeded error.
7. We are now using the Pytorch Sequential Model with the previous neural network's weights and biases.
